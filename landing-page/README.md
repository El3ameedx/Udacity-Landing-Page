This the project notes of my landing page project.

I tried to use every thing I learned on this course and in the previous to build a dynamic web page.

I added a navigation bar using javascript

I added two buttons using css and made them to add or remove new sections using javascript.

I used THE MDN website to learn a new function called getboundingclientrec() to use it for giving the active section an active class.

I searched the internet for a function to give a smooth scroll to the page without the html {behavior smooth} thing and I found a 

scrollintoview function that helped me achieve that.
